### How to run:
1. In the terminal cd to ./API
2. Run `dotnet watch`
3. Create a new terminal and cd to ./client-app
4. run `npm start`
5. using Docker hub, download and run postgres:latest
   
 Disclaimer: These steps are dependent on npm and the dotnet cli being installed. There is also a dockerfile but it's throwing errors currently.
